# FLOWFoil

FLOWFoil is a two dimensional potential flow solver (panel method) for airfoils and airfoil systems.
The formulation used for FLOWFoil follows closely those of [XFoil](https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/) and [mfoil](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kfid/codes.html) (see also [references](#References) below).

Currently, FLOWFoil only has inviscid capabilties for single and multi-element airfoils.
Future additions will include visous capabilties for both single and multi-element airfoils as well.
