# FLOWFoil

FLOWFoil is a two dimensional potential flow solver (panel method) for airfoils and airfoil systems.
The formulation used for FLOWFoil follows closely those of XFoil and mfoil (see references below).

Currently, FLOWFoil only has inviscid capabilties for single and multi-element airfoils.
Future additions will include visous capabilties for both single and multi-element airfoils as well.
