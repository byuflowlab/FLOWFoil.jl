# Theory

As the current implementations follow very closely those presented in the links below, we encourage interested parties to read through
[Drela, M., “XFOIL: An Analysis and Design System for Low Reynolds Number Airfoils,” 1989.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-84010-4_1)
and [Fidkowski, K. J., “A Coupled Inviscid-Viscous Airfoil Analysis Solver, Revisited,” AIAA Journal, 2021.](https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J061341) for the theory behind the 2D airfoil analysis methods.

For those interested in the theory for the axisymmetric solver methods to see [R. I. Lewis, "Vortex Element Methods for fluid Dynamic Analysis of Engineering Systems," 1991](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511529542)---specifically chapter 4.
