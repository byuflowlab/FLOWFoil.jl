# Airfoil Tools

AirfoilTools is a submodule of FLOWFoil containing useful airfoil geometry generation and manipulation routines that are commonly used in the BYU FLOW Lab.

## Contribution

We welcome additional airfoil parameterization methods as well as convenient geometry manipulation routines that make life easier when working with airfoil analysis and optimization.
